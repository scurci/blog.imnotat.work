	Hey guys, and girls, and anyone who identifies otherwise; my name is Sarah, but I prefer to go by Sam. I’m currently twenty years old, a biology major, part of the working class, a photographer, and a lot more that we’ll both learn about as time goes on. 

	I’m not going to write about anything in particular but my favorite subjects will probably come up more than others. I’m going to talk a lot about science, travel, personal growth and struggles, and feminism. I’ll probably write about a lot of other things as well but this is just a quick little overview of what you might expect coming from me.

	All of us are super friendly here as well and if you ever want advice on anything, I’d love to take questions and help out in anyway I can. If you ever want to debate, clarification on something, or have something you want me to cover, I’m open to all of that too. I’m also going to be posting all my articles on Tumblr as well at sarahspeaks.tumblr.com.
